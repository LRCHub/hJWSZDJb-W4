I got a bad habit
Slowly sinking in
I got a bad habit, yeah
Slowly sinking in

Got me hearing voices
Seeing through my skin

When a man gives you his hat
He's living on borrowed time
When a man gives you his hat
He's living on borrowed time

The shoe fit so I wore it
But I left one lace untied

Just a bad habit, na
Of wanting what I need
Got a bad habit
Of wanting what I need

I may have been born but
I ain't never been freed

I cry once a day
It's a condition of the heart
Oh, I cry once a day, Lord
It's a condition of the heart

You're like a puzzle in a box
But I'm the one coming all apart

Got a bad habit
You know the one I mean
I got a bad habit now
You know the one I mean

No before, no after
Only in between

It's a bad habit
Buries me in the dark
Got a bad habit now
Burying me in de dark

Until the only light is
A match that just won't spark
The only light, only light
