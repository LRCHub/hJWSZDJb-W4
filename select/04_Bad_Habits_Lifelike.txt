Wake up, wake up
I think I've had enough
I feel it stirring inside
Another drink to make things alright

Bad Habits befriending me in the dark
My skeletons are all I have in the end
It's all I have in the end

Crawling out from this deep abyss
I found myself in a place that feels so empty
There's no way I could live like this
So take my hand, understand that this isn't permanent

Everything is faded
My mind's nothing but jaded
Loved ones turned to hated
In a life so overrated

Bad Habits befriending me in the dark
My skeletons are all I have in the end
The end, the end, it's all I have in the end

Crawling out from this deep abyss
I found myself in a place that feels so empty
There's no way I could live like this
So take my hand, understand that this isn't permanent

I'm finally realizing that this is where it starts
My mind's been running faster, faster
I'm finally realizing that this is where it starts
My mind's been running faster than my beating heart

Seeking solace in my worst of fears
Stripped of my soul while the end draws near

I let this go
You couldn't see it
But in the end you will believe it
Liar, liar, you lost your fire
The end is near
You're walking the wire

Crawling out from this deep abyss I
Found myself in a place that feels so empty
That feels so empty

Crawling out from this deep abyss
I found myself in a place that feels so empty
There's no way I could live like this
So take my hand, understand that this isn't permanent

I'm finally realizing that this is where it starts
My mind's been running faster, faster
I'm finally realizing that this is where it starts
My mind's been running faster than my beating heart
